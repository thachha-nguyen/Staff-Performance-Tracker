# Clinic Performance Tracker

## Short Description  
**ClinicPerformanceTracker** is a data-driven solution designed to streamline employee performance management at clinics. This project includes two main deliverables:  
1. An interactive **dashboard** built in **Metabase** to track and visualize employee performance metrics.  
2. A **target generator tool** built in **Streamlit** using Python to efficiently set employee performance targets.

## Introduction  

### Background  
Efficient employee performance management is critical for healthcare facilities to ensure quality service delivery and resource optimization. To address this, the **ClinicPerformanceTracker** project was developed to empower clinic managers with real-time insights into staff performance and provide tools to set performance goals effectively.  

This project was initiated to solve key challenges faced by clinic managers, such as:  
- Tracking employee performance across various metrics.  
- Setting and managing weekly-monthly-yearly target hours for staff members.  
- Streamlining data visualization and analysis processes.  

### Deliverables  

#### 1. **Performance Dashboard**  
The dashboard, built using **Metabase**, provides clinic managers with a comprehensive view of employee performance. Key features include:  
- Real-time performance tracking by location, manager, and staff.  
- Aggregated performance metrics (actual working hours vs. target hours).  
- Interactive filters for customization (e.g., date, location, and manager).  

#### 2. **Target Generator Tool**  
The target generator, built in **Streamlit**, enables clinics to set performance targets for employees. This tool simplifies the annual target cloning process by:  
- Cloning target hours from the previous year to the upcoming year.  
- Allowing adjustments to target hours (ranging from 4â€“7 hours per day per person).  
- Exporting updated targets to integrate with the performance dashboard seamlessly.
